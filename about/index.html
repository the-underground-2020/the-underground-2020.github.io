		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h3>What is Firetable?</h3>
		<p>
			A way to listen to music with friends.
		</p>
		<h3>Who is Jarvis?</h3>
		<p>
			Jarvis is a bot. He keeps the order.
		</p>
		<h3>How do I join the waitlist?</h3>

			!addme
		</p>
		<h3>Is there a limit to how many songs I can play?</h3>
		<p>

		</p>
		<h3>Can I change my robot avatar?</h3>
		<p>
			Robot avatars are generated based on a combination of your username and userid. So if change your username, you'll also be changing your robot.
		</p>
		<h3>I typed !addme but I am not on the table how do i get on the table now that I have typed !addme i think there must be a mistake because i did type it but i do not see myself there in the thing?!?!?!?!?</h3>
		<p>
			The DJ table is probably full and you've been added to the waitlist. As the DJs all play 2 songs each, spots will open up and those spots will be filled from the waitlist.
		</p>
